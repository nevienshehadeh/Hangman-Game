# Hangman-Game
The Game of Hangman:  The user of the game has 8 chances to guess a word. The secret word is represented to the player with a '_' in each missing letter. The game allows the user to enter a letter of their chose, if the letter is in the secret word, the game tells the player this  and reveals all instances of that letter in the secret word. If the letter is not in the word, the game tells the player this and subtract 1 from the players 8 chances. However, if the user tries to guess the same letter previously entered, the game will not remove a chance from their number of chances; rather, it will give them another chance (and continue to do this until a new letter is entered).
